                <p>The Book Review Web Application adopts a relational database model for structured data organization. Core entities include Users, Books, Reviews, and Comments, interconnected to capture user-book interactions. User profiles store authentication details, and the Books entity serves as a central repository. Reviews and Ratings, Comments, and search functionalities are optimized through strategic indexing. The scalable design prioritizes normalization, ensuring performance as the database grows. Security measures, such as encryption and role-based access control, safeguard data integrity. Maintenance routines, backups, and a recovery plan uphold ongoing database health and support future expansions.</p>
